## What Is accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What is next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.




## Deorum petiit ignis

Lorem markdownum longo os thyrso telum, continet servat fetus nymphae, *vox
nocte sedesque*, decimo. Omnia esse, quam sive; conplevit illis indestrictus
admovit dedit sub quod protectus, impedit non.
